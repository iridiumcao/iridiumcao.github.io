按：本章从经济学上设计了一套正向激励机制，难能可贵，对人类社会由开创性的意义。

## 6. Incentive 激励

> By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.

> The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction.  Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.

> The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

解读如下：

> By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. 

按约定，一个区块中的第一笔交易是一笔特殊的交易，它创建一枚新的硬币，所有权为该区块的创建者。

这就是说，每当区块创建时，系统会无中生有铸造一些比特币给去区块的创建者。这部分比特币也称作“区块奖励”。在一开始，区块奖励是50BTC/block，大约4年减半，目前（2023.05.01）只有6.25BTC了，预计2024年区块奖励会再度减半。区块奖励是矿工的动力之一。

> This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. 

这为节点支持比特币网络增加了激励，也提供了在没有中央机构的情况下初始分发货币到流通领域的方式。

> The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. 

新的比特币按固定的量稳定地增发，这类似金矿的矿工消耗资源获取黄金并投入到流通领域。

> In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.

对我们而言（在比特币网络中），消耗的资源是CPU时间和电力。

> The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. 

交易手续费也是激励的一部分。

> If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction.  

如果交易的输出金额小于输入金额，那么金额差值就是手续费。手续费会添加到区块的激励金额中。

> Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.

一旦预定量的硬币数量投入到流通领域，用于激励的金额将全部过渡到由手续费构成，这也完全避免了通货膨胀。

* transition, v. 转变，过渡。它在这里是个动词，动词！

> The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. 

激励机制有助于鼓励节点保持诚实。

> If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. 

如果贪婪的攻击者可以集合更多的CPU算力，比诚实节点还多，它不得不面临这样的选择：用它来行骗去偷回它已经支付的比特币，还是用它去生成新的比特币。

> He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

他应该发现按规则行事更有利可图，这些规则使他获得比其他人加起来更多的新币，而不是破坏系统和自己财富的有效性。
