# Reading Through the Bitcoin White Paper, 通读比特币白皮书

## 12. Conclusion 总结

> We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. 

我们已经构想了一个不基于信任的电子交易系统。

> We started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. 

我们带数字签名的创建货币框架开始，数字签名对所有权有强有力的控制，但双花问题无能为力。

> To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. 

为了解决这个问题，我们构想了一个点对点网络并使用工作量证明去记录交易的公开历史。如果诚实节点够多，占据了大部分算力，对攻击者来说，在计算上更改交易历史是不可行的。

> The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. 

网络因为它的非结构化的简单性而稳固。

白皮书中文版的翻译是“网络因为其结构简洁性而强大”，读起来很上口，但含义上感觉不是很妥。

> Nodes work all at once with little coordination. 

节点之间只需要很小的协调就能同时工作。

> They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. 

它们不需要认证，因为信息不会发送到任何指定的位置，只需要尽力传播。

> Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. 

节点可以在任何时候离开或重新加入，并接受工作量证明链作为它们离开期间发生事件的证据。

> They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. 

他们用CPU算力投票，通过延长有效区块表示其接受，拒绝无效区块来表达抵制。

> Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

任何需要的规则和激励都可以通过这个共识机制来加强。
