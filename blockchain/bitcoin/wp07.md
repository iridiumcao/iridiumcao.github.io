# Reading Through the Bitcoin White Paper, 通读比特币白皮书

[返回目录](whitepaper.md)

按：本章的关键是Merkle树。

## 7. Reclaiming Disk Space 回收磁盘空间

> Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space.

解读如下：

> Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. 

一旦一个硬币最近的交易被足够多的节点覆盖，这个交易之前的交易就可以丢弃以节省磁盘空间。

* bury，埋，经过九年义务教育的学习，一般只晓得它的意思是“埋葬”，但其实它的本意是“埋”，不只是埋死人。这里的用法很形象，把一个交易埋在区块里。可以这么想象，这条交易被某个区块包含后，就埋进去了，新的区块增加了，埋它的“土”也增厚了。翻译的话，就译成“覆盖”也还行。

> To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [^7][^2][^5], with only the root included in the block's hash. 

为了让这（节省磁盘空间）容易一些，并且不破坏区块的哈希，区块中的哈希使用默克尔（Merkle）树，只有根哈希包含在区块哈希中。

> Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. 

旧的区块可以通过剪掉默克尔树的枝干进行压缩。

> The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

内部的哈希无需保存。

其实就是除了根哈希，其余的哈希都不必保存。

一个不带交易信息的区块头大约占80字节。

> If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. 

如果我们假定每10分钟生成一个区块，一年生成的数据是 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB

> With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

2008年在售的电脑基本上都有2GB的内存，按照摩尔定律预测每年增长1.2GB，即使区块头需要存放在内存中，存储也不是问题。
